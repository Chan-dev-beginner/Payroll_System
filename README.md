## Installation

1. Copy the project folder to your XAMPP `htdocs` directory.
2. Import `payroll_system.sql` into your MySQL database.
3. Update `config/database.php` with your MySQL credentials.
4. Open the project in your browser, for example:
   - `http://localhost/Payroll_system/`
5. The root `index.php` redirects to the login page.

## Project Structure

- `index.php` - Application entry point and redirect to login
- `config/` - Database and session helper files
- `includes/` - Main application pages and logic for HR, attendance, leave, payroll, and reports
- `assets/` - CSS stylesheets for dashboard and pages
- `payroll_system.sql` - Database schema and seed data

## Usage

- Login as an employee or HR/admin to access the dashboard.
- Employees can manage attendance, request leave, and view payslips.
- HR/Admin users can manage employees, approve or reject leave requests, handle incentives, and view payroll records.

## Notes

- The project uses relative paths for includes and redirects to simplify deployment inside the `Payroll_system` folder.
- If you rename the folder, update any absolute redirects or links in `index.php` if needed.
